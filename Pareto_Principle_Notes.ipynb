    "# Pareto Principle Notes\n",
    "The pareto principle essentially states that there is a non-linear, hyperbolic relationship between resource inputs and results. \n",

    "\n",
    "- 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. \n",
    "- Therefore we can say that the ROI on the last 80% is significantly lower than on the first 20%. \n",
    "- From an economics perspective, we should seek to maximise ROI, and seek to eliminate sub-optimal resource expenditure. \n",
    "- Work follows a pattern of diminishing returns, therefore at some point it makes sense to stop, and put your effort into other, more rewarding pursuits.\n",
    "- Trimming the fat is a smart and economical approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Leveraging the Pareto Principle\n",
    "The pareto principle can be applied iteratively to reduce input efforts to only the most minimal, whilst maximising the ROI. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "- Start with 100% effort and 100% results.\n",
    "- Apply pareto and find that 80% of results are coming from 20% of efforts.\n",
    "- Cut out the other 80% of low ROI effort, now you have 20% effort and 80% results.\n",
    "- Repeat pareto evaluation\n",
    "- 4% efforts (20% * 20%), 64% results (80% * 80*)\n",
    "- Repeat pareto analysis and cut the extra effort out.\n",
    "- 1% efforts now lead to 64% * 80%  = 51%"
