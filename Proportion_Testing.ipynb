    "## Example Scenario\n",
    "According to a 2016 survey, 58% of American homes have tablets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your manager has asked you to test the hypothesis with 97% significance that 58% of American homes have a tablet. \n",
    "\n",
    "You surveyed 100 random US households and found that 73 of them had tablets. \n",
    "\n",
    "- H0: 58% or fewer homes have a tablet.\n",
    "- H1: more than 58% of homes have a tablet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we have conducted hypothesis tests using the mean statistic. In this scenario, we are testing the proportion statistic - not the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "To use this method, we must check that the **proportion of the sample that is positive, p hat, is more than 10**, and, that the **proportion of the sample that is negative, q hat, is more than 10**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- n = 100\n",
    "- p-hat = 73%\n",
    "- q-hat = 27%\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- p-hat * n = 73 > 10\n",
    "- q-hat * n = 27 > 10\n",
    "\n",
    "In proportion testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "the **mean of the population = p**\n",
    "\n",
    "the **standard deviation of the population is equal to root( populationp * populationq )**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in hypothesis testing for the sample mean, we want to apply CLT and build a distribution of proportions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is, if I take loads of samples, each of sample size n, and then for each sample, plot the frequency of occurence for different values of p, the result will be a normal distribution, with \n",
    "\n",
    "**For the sampling distribution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- mean = populationp\n",
    "- sd = population standard deviation / root( n )\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is the same, place p-hat, in this case 0.73, on your sampling distribution, compute the difference from the mean, and divide by standard deviation. Then look it up in the Z table. "
