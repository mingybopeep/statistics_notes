    "You are a consultant engaged by a factory that manufactures spoons. \n",
    "\n",
    "The factory executives recently spent 10,000,000USD upgrading equipment and processes in order to combat excessively high defects in manufacturing (**23%**) which were leading to high return rates from clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been asked to prove (with **95% confidence**) that new equipment has improved the situation and that the number of defective spoons has decreased to **under 18%**. You have been supplied with a random sample of **150 spoons** and found that **23 spoons have defects**. \n",

    "2. Test whether the situation has less than 18% defect rate. \n",
