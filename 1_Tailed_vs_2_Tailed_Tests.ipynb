    "In a 2 tailed test, the goal is to test if something is more or less than a value. It is a measure of dispersion, and does not care about direction.\n",

    "## Examples of which test to use\n",
    "A factory producing juice claims there is no more than 10g of sugar per serving. \n",
    "\n",
    "h0: There is less than or equal to 10g of sugar per serving. \n",
    "h1: There is more than 10g of sugar per serving. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a one sided test because it is specifiying direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "A factory producing paper claims the thickness of each sheet is 0.05mm. \n",
    "\n",
    "h0: Each sheet = 0.05mm\n",
    "h1: Each sheet != 0.05mm\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a 2 sided test because it is not specifying a direction (more than, less than), it is just stating a value, and the goal is to see whether reality aligns with that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, you only have a given area of acceptance. Eg, A 90% confidence level means that 90% of the values i.e. 90% of the area under the curve is your acceptance area. Anything outside of that allocated 90% is your rejection area. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a single tail test, you can divide the chart into 2 segments: 90% and 10%. In a 2 tailed test, you have to split the chart into 3 segments: The 90% acceptance zone, and then on either side of it you have a 5% rejection zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, two tailed tests are favoured because they don't assume a direction. In the real world, there's no certainty about whether something will go up or down, so it's better to use a 2 tailed test"
