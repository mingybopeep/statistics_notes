    "In this scenario, the probability of 6 tails in a row, in the case of a fair coin, is extremely low, 1.5%. This low probability means we are justified in questioning the validity of the null hypothesis.\n",

    "Once you begin seeing events with a probability of less than 5%, you can reject a hypothesis."
